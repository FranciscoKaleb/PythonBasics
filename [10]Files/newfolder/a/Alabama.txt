'''Alabama''' ({{IPAc-en|,|æ|l|ə|'|b|æ|m|ə|}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeastern]] region of the [[United States]], bordered by [[Tennessee]] to the north; [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the east; [[Florida]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the south; and [[Mississippi]] to the west.

Alabama is nicknamed the ''[[Northern flicker|Yellowhammer]] State'', after the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]]. Alabama is also known as the &quot;Heart of [[Dixie]]&quot; and the &quot;Cotton State&quot;. The [[List of U.S. state and territory trees|state tree]] is the [[longleaf pine]], and the [[List of U.S. state and territory flowers|state flower]] is the [[camellia]].

Originally home to many native tribes, present-day Alabama was a Spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the French acquired it in the early eighteenth century. The British won the territory in 1763 until losing it in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Spain held Mobile as part of [[Spanish West Florida]] until 1813. In December 1819, Alabama was recognized as a state. During the antebellum period, Alabama was a major [[Cotton production in the United States|producer of cotton]], and widely used [[African Americans|African American]] [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor. In 1861, the state seceded from the United States to become part of the [[Confederate States of America]], with Montgomery acting as its first capital, and rejoined the Union in 1868. Following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship, in part due to [[agriculture]] and a few [[cash crops]] being the main driver of the state's economy. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] from the late 19th century up until the 1960s.  High-profile events such as the [[Selma to Montgomery march]] made the state a major focal point of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1950s and 1960s.

During and after [[World War II]], Alabama grew as the state's [[Economic diversity|economy diversified]] with new industries. [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] would help Alabama's economic growth in the mid-to-late 20th century, by developing an [[aerospace]] industry. Alabama's economy in the 21st century is based on automotive, finance, tourism, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;alaindustrial&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008–2018 |website=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |access-date=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state's geography is diverse, with the north dominated by the mountainous [[Tennessee Valley]] and the south by [[Mobile Bay]], a historically significant port. Politically, as part of the [[Deep South]], Alabama is predominantly a [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] state, and is known for its [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern culture]]. Within Alabama, [[American football]], particularly at the [[college football|college]] level, plays a major part of the state's culture.

== Etymology ==
The European-American naming of the [[Alabama River]] and state was derived from the [[Alabama people]], a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking tribe]] whose members lived just below the [[confluence]] of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] rivers on the upper reaches of the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=978-0-8173-0231-3 |oclc=10724679}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Alabama language]], the word for a person of Alabama lineage is {{lang|akz|Albaamo}} (or variously {{lang|akz|Albaama}} or {{lang|akz|Albàamo}} in different dialects; the plural form is {{lang|akz|Albaamaha}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Sylestine, Cora |author2=Hardy, Heather |author3=[[Timothy Montler|Montler, Timothy]] |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-292-73077-9 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024054330/http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |archive-date=October 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word's spelling varies significantly among historical sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/statenam.html |title=Alabama: The State Name |access-date=August 2, 2007 |website=All About Alabama |publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628215841/http://www.archives.alabama.gov/statenam.html |archive-date=June 28, 2007 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first usage appears in three accounts of the [[Hernando de Soto]] expedition of 1540: [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega|Garcilaso de la Vega]] used {{lang|es|Alibamo}}, while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote ''Alibamu'' and ''Limamu'', respectively, in [[transliteration]]s of the term.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt; As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the {{lang|fr|Alibamon}}, with French maps identifying the river as {{lang|fr|Rivière des Alibamons}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;/&gt; Other spellings of the name have included ''Alibamu'', ''Alabamo'', ''Albama'', ''Alebamon'', ''Alibama'', ''Alibamou'', ''Alabamu'', ''Allibamou''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wills&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wills |first=Charles A. |title=A Historical Album of Alabama |year=1995 |publisher=The Millbrook Press |isbn=978-1-56294-591-6 |oclc=32242468 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/historicalalbumo0000will_y2e2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffith&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Griffith |first=Lucille |title=Alabama: A Documentary History to 1900|year=1972 |publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=978-0-8173-0371-6 |oclc=17530914}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly ''Alabahmu''.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--source might be in print only--&gt; The use of state names derived from [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] is common in the U.S.; an estimated 26 states have names of Native American origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weiss&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weiss |first=Sonia |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Baby Names |year=1999 |publisher=Macmillan USA |isbn=978-0-02-863367-1 |oclc=222611214 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/completeidiotsgu00weis_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources disagree on the word's meaning.

[[File:Moundville Archaeological Site Alabama.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in Hale County. It was occupied by Native Americans of the [[Mississippian culture]] from 1000 to 1450 CE.]]

[[Indigenous peoples]] of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes by the [[Ohio River]] began during the Burial Mound Period (1000{{nbs}}BCE{{snd}}700{{nbs}}CE) and continued until [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorkTimesAlmanac&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |title=Alabama |date=August 11, 2006 |work=The New York Times Almanac 2004 |access-date=September 23, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016195242/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |archive-date=October 16, 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agrarian [[Mississippian culture]] covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 CE, with one of its major centers built at what is now the [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in [[Moundville, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Welch |first= Paul D. |title= Moundville's Economy |publisher= University of Alabama Press |year= 1991 |isbn= 978-0-8173-0512-3 |oclc= 21330955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Walthall |first= John A. |title= Prehistoric Indians of the Southeast-Archaeology of Alabama and the Middle South |publisher= University of Alabama Press |year= 1990 |isbn= 978-0-8173-0552-9 |oclc= 26656858}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after [[Cahokia]] in present-day [[Illinois]], which was the center of the culture.

The Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama during their exploration of North America in the 16th century. The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through [[Mabila]] and other parts of the state in 1540. More than 160 years later, the French founded the region's first European settlement at [[Old Mobile Site|Old Mobile]] in 1702.&lt;ref name=&quot;US50&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theus50.com/alabama/ |title=Alabama State History |access-date=September 23, 2006 |publisher=theUS50.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825052401/http://www.theus50.com/alabama/ |archive-date=August 25, 2006 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was moved to the current site of Mobile in 1711.

After the French lost to the British in the [[Seven Years' War]], it became part of British [[West Florida]] from 1763 to 1783. After the United States victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]], the territory was divided between the United States and Spain.

Thomas Bassett, a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] to the [[British Empire|British monarchy]] during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile.

What is now the counties of [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin]] and Mobile became part of [[Spanish West Florida]] in 1783, part of the independent [[Republic of West Florida]] in 1810, and was finally added to the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the [[Yazoo lands]] beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the [[Province of Georgia]] from 1767 onwards.

Before Mississippi's admission to statehood on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the [[Alabama Territory]].

By 1860, the population had increased to 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080, were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were [[free people of color]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adahtmln&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/timeline/al1801.html |title=Alabama History Timeline |website=Alabama Department of Archives and History |publisher=State of Alabama |access-date=September 22, 2012 |archive-date=June 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618035649/http://www.archives.alabama.gov/timeline/al1801.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its [[Secession in the United States|secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].

From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: [[Jeremiah Haralson]], [[Benjamin S. Turner]], and [[James T.

Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During Reconstruction, state legislators ratified a [[Constitution of Alabama|new state constitution]] in 1868 which created the state's first public school system and expanded women's rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and [[misappropriation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alrecnstrctn&quot;/&gt; Organized [[Insurgency|insurgent]], resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans.

Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence.

The new 1901 Constitution of Alabama included provisions for [[voter registration]] that effectively [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor European Americans, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]] and [[literacy test]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan Kousser. ''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools. By 1903 only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were [[Literacy|literate]]. This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900. The numbers dropped even more in later decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt; The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;jimcrowala&quot;/&gt;

While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt; By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;&gt;Glenn Feldman. ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all Blacks had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1248 |title=Segregation (Jim Crow) |website=Encyclopedia of Alabama |access-date=May 26, 2018 |archive-date=May 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530141129/http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1248 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://southernspaces.org/2004/black-belt |title= The Black Belt |access-date= September 23, 2006 |date= April 19, 2004 |journal= Southern Spaces |publisher= Emory University |doi= 10.18737/M70K6P |last1= Tullos |first1= Allen |doi-access= free |archive-date= January 11, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110111023122/http://southernspaces.org/2004/black-belt |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the [[Rosenwald Fund]] began funding the construction of what came to be known as [[Rosenwald School]]s. In Alabama, these schools were designed, and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas. They often donated land and labor as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenwaldal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Rosenwald School Building Fund and Associated Buildings MPS |website=National Register Information System |url={{NRHP url|id=64500011}} |access-date=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued racial discrimination and [[lynching]]s, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to [[boll weevil]] infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hine |first1=Darlene |last2=Hine |first2=William |last3=Harrold |first3=Stanley |title=African Americans: A Concise History |date=2012 |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=Boston |isbn=9780205806270 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/africanamericans0000hine_i0f5/page/388 388–389] |edition=4th |url=https://archive.org/details/africanamericans0000hine_i0f5/page/388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Migration |title=Great Migration {{!}} African-American history |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=May 26, 2018 |archive-date=May 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527024942/https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Migration |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see &quot;historical populations&quot; table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;census data&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Resident Population Data |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |title=Resident Population Data—2010 Census |publisher=2010.census.gov |access-date=January 31, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519131122/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |archive-date=May 19, 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Beginning in the 1940s, when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters, the Alabama legislature took several counter-steps designed to disfranchise black voters. The legislature passed, and the voters ratified [as these were mostly white voters], a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants. Black citizens in Mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]. The legislature also changed the boundaries of [[Tuskegee, Alabama|Tuskegee]] to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits. The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial &quot;[[gerrymandering]]&quot; violated the Constitution. In 1961,{{nbs}}... the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;vra&quot;&gt;James Blacksher, Edward Still, Nick Quinton, Cullen Brown and Royal Dumas.

Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;/&gt; Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile.

Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. One result was that [[Jefferson County, Alabama|Jefferson County]], containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, &quot;a minority of about 25% of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017192719/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archive-date=October 17, 2007 |title=George Mason University, United States Election Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary.|access-date=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that public schools had to be [[Desegregation in the United States|desegregated]], but Alabama was slow to comply. During the 1960s, under Governor [[George Wallace]], Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5JJCAAAQBAJ&amp;q=alabama+brown+v.+board&amp;pg=PT94 |title=Brown v.

Legal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but Jim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDOJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/voting.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221054512/http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/voting.htm |archive-date=February 21, 2007 |title=Voting Rights |access-date=September 23, 2006 |date=January 9, 2002 |website=Civil Rights: Law and History |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', by 2017, many of Alabama's African Americans were living in Alabama's cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery. Also, the Black Belt region across central Alabama &quot;is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly African-American. These counties include Dallas, [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes]], [[Marengo County, Alabama|Marengo]] and [[Perry County, Alabama|Perry]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_2017&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Alabama Senate Race Between Roy Moore and Doug Jones Ends With More Controversy |first1=Jonathan |last1=Martin |first2=Alan |last2=Blinder |date=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot; /&gt; Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.

Alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[Dillard v. Crenshaw County]]'', challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;vra&quot; /&gt;

As part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use [[limited voting]], as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;cum&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Cumulative Elections in Alabama (2004) |url=http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 |publisher=FairVote Archives |access-date=January 11, 2015 |archive-date=February 3, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203203843/http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1960s, the state's economy shifted away from its traditional lumber, steel, and textile industries because of increased foreign competition. Steel jobs, for instance, declined from 46,314 in 1950 to 14,185 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bridges |first1=Edwin |title=Alabama: The Making of an American State |date=2016 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the state, particularly Huntsville, benefited from the opening of the [[Marshall Space Flight Center|George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]] in 1960, a major facility in the development of the Saturn rocket program and the space shuttle. Technology and manufacturing industries, such as automobile assembly, replaced some the state's older industries in the late twentieth century, but the state's economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area, such as Georgia and Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bridges |first1=Edwin |title=Alabama: The Making of an American State |date=2016 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |pages=224–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Alabama Supreme Court chief justice [[Roy Moore]] installed a statue of the [[Ten Commandments]] in the capitol in Montgomery. In 2002, the 11th US Circuit Court ordered the statue removed, but Moore refused to follow the court order, which led to protests around the capitol in favor of keeping the monument. The monument was removed in August 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Faulk |first1=Kent |title=A Roy Moore timeline: From Ten Commandments to senate candidate |url=https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2016/05/a_roy_moore_timeline_from_ten.html |website=al.com |access-date=February 6, 2021 |date=May 8, 2016 |archive-date=August 13, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200813094511/https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2016/05/a_roy_moore_timeline_from_ten.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Alabama}}

The state is classified as [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'') under the [[Köppen climate classification|Koppen Climate Classification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1283 |title=Encyclopedia of Alabama: Climate |date=August 17, 2007 |publisher=University of Alabama |access-date=April 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621180731/http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1283 |archive-date=June 21, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual temperature is 64{{nbs}}°F (18{{nbs}}°C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], while the northern parts of the state, especially in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-78303/Alabama |title=Alabama Climate |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=October 24, 2010 |archive-date=June 16, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616140321/https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-78303/Alabama |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of {{convert|56|in|mm}} of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;/&gt;

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over {{convert|90|°F}} throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to [[Tropical cyclone|tropical storms and hurricanes]]. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.

South Alabama reports many [[thunderstorm]]s. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent [[lightning]] and large [[hail]]; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/stats/04-13state_fatality_rates.pdf Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States, 2004–2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010029/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/stats/04-13state_fatality_rates.pdf |date=April 27, 2014}}.

[[File:Phil Campbell tornado damage.jpg|thumb|left|Tornado damage in [[Phil Campbell, Alabama|Phil Campbell]] following the statewide [[2011 Super Outbreak|April 27, 2011, tornado outbreak]]]]
Alabama, along with [[Oklahoma]] and [[Iowa]], has the most confirmed [[Fujita scale|F5]] and [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF5]] tornadoes of any state, according to statistics from the [[National Climatic Data Center]] for the period January 1, 1950, to June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LIST: States with the most F5/EF5 tornadoes since 1950; Ohio high on list |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/weather/weather-news/kshb-list-states-with-the-most-ef5-tornadoes |access-date=April 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426232719/http://www.newsnet5.com/weather/weather-news/kshb-list-states-with-the-most-ef5-tornadoes |archive-date=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities since 1950 than any other state. The state was affected by the [[1974 Super Outbreak]] and was devastated tremendously by the 2011 Super Outbreak. The 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oliver |first=Mike |title=April 27's record tally: 62 tornadoes in Alabama |date=August 4, 2011 |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/08/april_27s_record_tally_62_torn.html |publisher=al.com |access-date=November 4, 2012 |archive-date=November 9, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109185256/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/08/april_27s_record_tally_62_torn.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December besides the typically severe spring. The northern part—along the Tennessee River Valley—is most vulnerable. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[Dixie Alley]], as distinct from the [[Tornado Alley]] of the Southern Plains.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the Southeastern United States, with average January low temperatures around {{convert|40|°F}} in Mobile and around {{convert|32|°F}} in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]] and the [[1993 Storm of the Century]]. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is {{convert|2|in|mm}} per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

Alabama's highest temperature of {{convert|112|°F}} was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of [[Centerville, Alabama|Centerville]]. The record low of {{convert|-27|°F}} occurred on January 30, 1966, in [[New Market, Alabama|New Market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/recordtemps.html |title=Record high and low temperatures for all 50 states |website=Internet Accuracy Project |publisher=accuracyproject.org |access-date=November 3, 2012 |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www.accuracyproject.org/recordtemps.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those citing &quot;[[United States|American]]&quot; ancestry in Alabama are of overwhelmingly [[English people|English]] extraction, however most [[English American]]s identify simply as having [[United States|American]] ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long, in many cases since the early 1600s.  Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly [[English American|English]] ancestry and state that the figure is probably much higher. In the 1980 census 1,139,976 people in Alabama cited that they were of [[English American|English]] ancestry out of a total state population of 2,824,719 making them 41% of the state at the time and the largest ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/files/pc80-s1-10/tab03.pdf |title=Ancestry of the Population by State: 1980 - Table 3&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=February 18, 2018 |archive-date=February 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224233043/http://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/files/pc80-s1-10/tab03.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Lieberson and Lawrence Santi, 'The Use of Nativity Data to Estimate Ethnic Characteristics and Patterns', ''Social Science Research'', Vol. 14, No. 1 (1985), pp. 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Lieberson and Mary C.

The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.&lt;ref&gt;David Hackett Fischer, Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America, New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.361–368&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black. The state has [[State-recognized tribes in the United States|officially recognized]] nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the American Southeast. These are the following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aiac.alabama.gov/ByLaws.aspx |title=AIAC Bylaws |website=Alabama Indian Affairs Commission |publisher=State of Alabama |access-date=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918101025/http://aiac.alabama.gov/ByLaws.aspx |archive-date=September 18, 2012 |df= mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language ===
Most Alabama residents (95.1% of those five and older) spoke only English at home in 2010, a minor decrease from 96.1% in 2000. Alabama English is predominantly [[Southern American English|Southern]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}} and is related to South Midland speech which was taken across the border from Tennessee. In the major Southern speech region, there is the decreasing loss of the final ''r'', for example the &quot;boyd&quot; pronunciation of &quot;bird&quot;. In the northern third of the state, there is a South Midland &quot;arm&quot; and &quot;barb&quot; rhyming with &quot;form&quot; and &quot;orb&quot;, respectively. Unique words in Alabama English include: redworm ([[earthworm]]), peckerwood ([[woodpecker]]), snake doctor and snake feeder ([[dragonfly]]), tow sack ([[Gunny sack|burlap bag]]), plum peach ([[Clingstone peach|clingstone]]), French harp (harmonica), and dog irons ([[andiron]]s).{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}

The state has invested in aerospace, education, health care, banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and [[Metal fabrication|fabrication]]. By 2006, crop and animal production in Alabama was valued at $1.5{{nbs}}billion. In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about one percent of the state's gross domestic product.

There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |title=Alabama Citizens for Constitutional Reform |publisher=Constitutionalreform.org |access-date=October 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915165938/http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |archive-date=September 15, 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that Alabama's constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands. Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.

[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]
Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[Legislature|legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''Reynolds v. Sims'' (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;, ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.

At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.

[[File:Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]] is the [[governor of Alabama]] as of 2021.]]
The [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the [[List of governors of Alabama|governor of Alabama]]. Other members of the executive branch include the cabinet, the [[List of lieutenant governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor of Alabama]], the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], the [[Secretary of State of Alabama|Alabama Secretary of State]], the [[Alabama State Treasurer]], and the [[State Auditor of Alabama]]. The current governor is Republican [[Kay Ivey]].

The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |title=Alabama's Legislative Process |first=McDowell |last=Lee |year=2009 |publisher=State of Alabama |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102162559/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html |archive-date=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[judiciary]] is responsible for interpreting the [[Constitution of Alabama]] and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The [[State supreme court|state's highest court]] is the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]. Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges. Since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJS&quot;&gt;[http://www.judicialselection.us/judicial_selection/index.cfm?state=AL Judicial Selection in the States: Alabama] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006162358/http://www.judicialselection.us/judicial_selection/index.cfm?state=AL |date=October 6, 2014}}, American Judicature Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The current [[chief justice]] of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican [[Tom Parker (judge)|Tom Parker]]. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party.

=== County and local governments ===
{{See also|List of counties in Alabama}}
{{Alabama County Labelled Map|align=right|width=300}}

Alabama has 67 [[county (United States)|counties]]. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.

The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;/&gt; Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''Baker v. Carr'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, to implement the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;. Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.

&quot;The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153 | title=Home Rule | first=Albert P. | last=Brewer | publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Alabama]] | access-date=February 4, 2015 | archive-date=February 3, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203220653/http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]], meaning the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. A total of 25 of the 67 counties are &quot;[[Dry county|dry counties]]&quot; which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities in counties which permit alcohol sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://alabcboard.gov/licensing-compliance/wet-cities | title=Wet Cities | publisher=Alabama ABC Board | access-date=January 19, 2022 | archive-date=January 19, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220119055341/https://alabcboard.gov/licensing-compliance/wet-cities | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
During Reconstruction following the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud, and intimidation.

After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.

From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.

Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor George Wallace, the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;/&gt; and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member district]]s that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.

In 2007, the Alabama Legislature passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing &quot;profound regret&quot; over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David |date=November 2, 2010 |work=[[The Birmingham News]] |access-date=July 9, 2018 |archive-date=July 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709153753/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2023|February|}}, there are a total of 3,707,233 registered voters, with 3,318,679 active, and the others inactive in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |access-date=March 2, 2023 |archive-date=December 8, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208174821/http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== State elections ====
With the disfranchisement of Blacks in 1901, the state became part of the &quot;[[Solid South]]&quot;, a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.

Members of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |access-date=August 7, 2009 |archive-date=May 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506035723/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry Hooper Sr.|Perry O. Hooper Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2016-04-26|title=Chief Justice Perry Hooper remembered as GOP pioneer|url=https://www.al.com/news/2016/04/alabama_chief_justice_perry_ho.html|access-date=2021-04-02|website=al|archive-date=June 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210613164025/https://www.al.com/news/2016/04/alabama_chief_justice_perry_ho.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.

In the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission, was defeated in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |access-date=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archive-date=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |access-date=August 7, 2009 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archive-date=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=al.com |access-date=June 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archive-date=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise. The three GOP lieutenant governors are [[Steve Windom]] (1999–2003), [[Kay Ivey]] (2011–2017), and [[Will Ainsworth]] (2019–present).

==== Local elections ====
Many local offices (county commissioners, boards of education, tax assessors, tax collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=1 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Democratic Primary Election Results—Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |access-date=August 7, 2009 |archive-date=November 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119050252/http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=1 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=2 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Republican Primary Election Results—Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date=February 15, 2007 |access-date=August 7, 2009 |archive-date=November 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119034105/http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=2 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, at-large races, and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts. The current split is 35 [[Alabama Democratic Party|Democrats]], 31 [[Alabama Republican Party|Republicans]], and one Independent Fayette.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/pages?id=41 |title=Alabama Sheriffs 2015–2019 |website=www.alabamasheriffs.com |access-date=September 29, 2015 |archive-date=September 30, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930172527/http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/pages?id=41 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties. The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties. {{as of|2015}}, the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in [[Morgan County, Alabama]], and ten African-American sheriffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASA&quot;/&gt;

==== Federal elections ====
The state's two [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are [[Katie Britt]] and [[Tommy Tuberville]], both of whom are Republican. In the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: ([[Jerry Carl]], [[Mike Rogers (Alabama politician)|Mike Rogers]], [[Robert Aderholt]], [[Dale Strong]], [[Barry Moore (Alabama politician)|Barry Moore]], and [[Gary Palmer (politician)|Gary Palmer]]) and one Democrat: [[Terri Sewell]], who represents the Black Belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of Birmingham, Tuscaloosa and Montgomery.

Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alsde.edu/sec/comm/Pages/quickfacts-item.aspx?FilterField1=ID&amp;FilterValue1=7 |title=Alabama Education Quick Facts 2012–13 |access-date=April 29, 2014 |format=PDF |archive-date=April 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429203418/http://www.alsde.edu/sec/comm/Pages/quickfacts-item.aspx?FilterField1=ID&amp;FilterValue1=7 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, more than 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National [[No Child Left Behind Act|No Child Left Behind]] law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama.

While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data (2000), Alabama's high school graduation rate (75%) is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]] and Mississippi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf |title=Educational Attainment : 2000 : Census 2000 Brief |website=Census.gov |access-date=December 29, 2016 |archive-date=April 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416222303/https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html Education Statistics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513164857/http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html |date=May 13, 2008 }}.

Generally prohibited in the West at large, [[school corporal punishment]] is not unusual in Alabama, with 27,260 public school students [[paddle (spanking)|paddled]] at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year.{{efn|This figure refers to only the number of students paddled, and does not refer to the number of instances of corporal punishment, which would be higher.}}&lt;ref name=&quot;CORPUN_US_SCHOOL&quot; /&gt; The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed by only Mississippi and Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;CORPUN_US_SCHOOL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corpun.com/counuss.htm |title=Corporal punishment in US schools |publisher=[[World Corporal Punishment Research]] |last=Farrell |first=Colin |date=February 2016 |access-date=April 4, 2016 |archive-date=April 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403071606/http://www.corpun.com/counuss.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aviation ===
{{Main|Aviation in Alabama}}

Major airports with sustained operations in Alabama include [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport]] (BHM), [[Huntsville International Airport]] (HSV), [[Dothan Regional Airport]] (DHN), [[Mobile Regional Airport]] (MOB), [[Montgomery Regional Airport]] (MGM), [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]]&lt;!--no longer Muscle Shoals Aux--&gt; (MSL) and [[Northeast Alabama Regional Airport]] (GAD).

=== Rail ===
{{Alabama rail network}}
For rail transport, [[Amtrak]] schedules the ''[[Crescent (train)|Crescent]]'', a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with station stops at [[Anniston station|Anniston]], [[Birmingham station (Alabama)|Birmingham]], and [[Tuscaloosa station|Tuscaloosa]].

=== Roads ===
Alabama has six major interstate routes: [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|Interstate 65]] (I-65) travels north–south roughly through the middle of the state; [[Interstate 20 in Alabama|I-20]]/[[Interstate 59 in Alabama|I-59]] travel from the central west Mississippi state line to Birmingham, where I-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state and I-20 continues east towards [[Atlanta]]; [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|I-85]] originates in Montgomery and travels east-northeast to the Georgia state line, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] traverses the southernmost portion of the state, traveling from west to east through Mobile. [[Interstate 22 in Alabama|I-22]] enters the state from Mississippi and connects Birmingham with [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. In addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: [[Interstate 165 (Alabama)|I-165]] in Mobile, [[Interstate 359|I-359]] in Tuscaloosa, [[Interstate 459|I-459]] around Birmingham, [[Interstate 565|I-565]] in Decatur and Huntsville, and [[Interstate 759|I-759]] in Gadsden. A sixth route, [[Interstate 685 (Alabama)|I-685]], will be formed when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery. A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will be designated as [[Interstate 422|I-422]]. Since a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not be possible, [[Interstate 222|I-222]] has been proposed, as well.

Several U.S. Highways also pass through the state, such as [[U.S. Route 11 in Alabama|U.S. Route 11]] (US-11), [[U.S. Route 29 in Alabama|US-29]], [[U.S. Route 31 in Alabama|US-31]], [[U.S. Route 43 in Alabama|US-43]], [[U.S. Route 45 in Alabama|US-45]], [[U.S. Route 72 in Alabama|US-72]], [[U.S. Route 78 in Alabama|US-78]], [[U.S. Route 80 in Alabama|US-80]], [[U.S. Route 82 in Alabama|US-82]], [[U.S. Route 84 in Alabama|US-84]], [[U.S. Route 90 in Alabama|US-90]], [[U.S. Route 98 in Alabama|US-98]], [[U.S. Route 231 in Alabama|US-231]], [[U.S. Route 278 in Alabama|US-278]], [[U.S. Route 280 in Alabama|US-280]], [[U.S. Route 331 in Alabama|US-331]], [[U.S. Route 411 in Alabama|US-411]], and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|US-431]].

There are four toll roads in the state: Montgomery Expressway in Montgomery; Northport/Tuscaloosa Western Bypass in Tuscaloosa and [[Northport, Alabama|Northport]]; Emerald Mountain Expressway in Wetumpka; and Beach Express in [[Orange Beach, Alabama|Orange Beach]].

=== Ports ===
The [[Port of Mobile]], Alabama's only saltwater port, is a large seaport on the Gulf of Mexico with inland waterway access to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] by way of the [[Tennessee–Tombigbee Waterway]]. The Port of Mobile was ranked 12th by tons of traffic in the United States during 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;tonstraffic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Table 1086.
